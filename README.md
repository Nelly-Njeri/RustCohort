## My First Rust Project

This is my first project using Rust programming language.

In this project, I implemented the classic "Hello, World!" program.

## About

This project serves as an introductory exploration into Rust programming. 

The "Hello, World!" program is a simple yet traditional way to kickstart learning a new programming language.

## Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. 

Then, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory.
 cd rustproject
Compile the program using the Rust compiler.
 rustc main.rs
Run the compiled executable.
 ./main
